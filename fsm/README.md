## Finite State Machine
Here are some example tasks implemented using a finite state machine.
### Sequence Detector 1
For this task, we are supposed to detect the sequence 1001 given a finite bitstream where the input is 1 bit per clock. 
### Sequence Detector 2
Similarly, for this task, we are supposed to detect two sequence: 101101 and 101001, given a finite bitstream where the input is 1 bit per clock.
